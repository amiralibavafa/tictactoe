# 🎮 Intelligent AI Tic-Tac-Toe 🤖

## 📝 Overview
This project is an advanced AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python. It offers a unique 3D Tic-Tac-Toe experience with board sizes of 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5. The game allows players to choose between three different AI algorithms:

- **🤖 Minimax**
- **🚀 Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **🎲 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**

The game is designed to showcase AI capabilities in game development and artificial intelligence strategies.

## 🔥 Features
- **📌 3D Tic-Tac-Toe:** Play on 3×3, 4×4, or 5×5 grids.
- **🧠 Multiple AI Algorithms:** Choose from Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo.
- **⏳ Adjustable AI Time for Large Boards:** For 4×4 and 5×5 grids, users can manually set the AI's thinking time (recommended: 8 seconds for optimal performance).
- **⚡ Instant Response for 3×3:** The AI processes moves instantly for 3×3 as the algorithms are fast enough.
- **📈 Dynamic Performance:** The game adapts to the system’s processing power, though response times may exceed 8 seconds on lower-end hardware.

## 🛠 Installation
### 📌 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **🐍 Python 3 or higher**
- **🖥 PyCharm IDE (recommended)**
- **🚀 Python Launcher**

### 🚀 Steps to Run
1. 📥 Clone or download the project repository.
2. 🖥 Open the project in **PyCharm** or any Python IDE.
3. ▶️ Run the main Python script using Python Launcher.
4. 🎮 Select the board size and AI algorithm from the dropdown menu.
5. (For 4×4 and 5×5) ⏳ Set the AI time limit as needed.
6. ✅ Start the game and enjoy the AI challenge!

## ⚠️ Notes
- ⏳ The AI may take longer than 8 seconds on complex calculations, depending on your system's processing power.
- ⏰ Providing more time to the AI results in better decision-making quality.
- 🎓 This project serves as a demonstration of AI techniques in game development.
