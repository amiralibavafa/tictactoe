# Intelligent AI Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview
This project is an advanced AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python. It offers a unique 3D Tic-Tac-Toe experience with board sizes of 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5. The game allows players to choose between three different AI algorithms:

- **Minimax**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**

The game is designed to showcase AI capabilities in game development and artificial intelligence strategies.

## Features
- **3D Tic-Tac-Toe:** Play on 3×3, 4×4, or 5×5 grids.
- **Multiple AI Algorithms:** Choose from Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo.
- **Adjustable AI Time for Large Boards:** For 4×4 and 5×5 grids, users can manually set the AI's thinking time (recommended: 8 seconds for optimal performance).
- **Instant Response for 3×3:** The AI processes moves instantly for 3×3 as the algorithms are fast enough.
- **Dynamic Performance:** The game adapts to the system’s processing power, though response times may exceed 8 seconds on lower-end hardware.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3 or higher**
- **PyCharm IDE (recommended)**
- **Python Launcher**

### Steps to Run
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in **PyCharm** or any Python IDE.
3. Run the main Python script using Python Launcher.
4. Select the board size and AI algorithm from the dropdown menu.
5. (For 4×4 and 5×5) Set the AI time limit as needed.
6. Start the game and enjoy the AI challenge!

## Notes
- The AI may take longer than 8 seconds on complex calculations, depending on your system's processing power.
- Providing more time to the AI results in better decision-making quality.
- This project serves as a demonstration of AI techniques in game development.
